### This is a repository containing my analysis and solutions to some Data Science and Data Engineering Topics and interesting data that i've crossed around the web. 
Here I try to deal with topics of Data Science and Machine Learning using technologies such as Python, Sql, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit, ntlk, Tensorflow, Seaborn and other popular tools.

Also I enjoy using some apis to get some data and start the ETL process, Also scrap some webs, and try to load into Data warehouses and build the Pipes using Hadoop or Apache.




### *All the solutions here are done by me as a product of work and research*
