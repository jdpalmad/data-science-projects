    "Banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. It is known that they reject many of them for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. At analyzing this applications we will have to handle with the missing values and preprocess the dataset to finally make a credit card approval predictor using Statistics and Machhine Learning.\n",

    "As mentioned, we will use the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The structure of this notebook is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - First, we will start off by loading and viewing the dataset.<br>\n",
    "> - We will see that the dataset has a mixture of both numerical and non-numerical features, that it contains values from different   ranges, plus that it contains a number of missing entries.<br> \n",
    "> - We will have to preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model we choose can make good predictions.<br> \n",
    "> - After our data is in good shape, we will do some exploratory data analysis to build our intuitions.<br> \n",
    "> - Finally, we will build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.<br> \n",
