This project is in one of a similar name from Datacamp and some of the ideas are taken from there, the Dataset is provided by Kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet

##### *All the solutions are done by my own analysis and understanding of the problem suggested from Datacamp Project's Team and the markdows are done by me as a result of the research of some model trainings about the same or similar data.*

Also this is done using Python packages like Numpy, Keras, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn.

# **Project Description given by Datacamp**
American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf individuals in North America, and it is also used by hard-of-hearing and hearing individuals. The language is as rich as spoken languages and employs signs made with the hand, along with facial gestures and bodily postures.

In this project, you will train a convolutional neural network to classify images of ASL letters. After loading, examining, and preprocessing the data, you will train the network and test its performance.


**Project Tasks**
1. American Sign Language (ASL)
2. Visualize the training data
3. Examine the dataset
4. Handling images
5. Define the model
6. Compile the model
7. Train the model
8. Test the model
