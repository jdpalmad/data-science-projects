This project is taken from Datacamp and the dataset can be found at Datacamp and was collected by Ignaz Semmelweis, Here we will to re analyze all the data to get the same results as the original work done by the Hungarian Physician.

##### *All the solutions are done by my own analysis and understanding of the problem suggested from Datacamp Project's Team and the markdows are paraphased from the original project as i added my own comments and analysis and removed son comments that i found not necessary.*

In this project, we will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected. We will use the data to calculate the annual number of deaths from puerperal fever at the two clinics and then use statistical analysis to draw a conclusion about the effect of handwashing.
